Title: Hierarchical Heatmaps! Create high quality heatmaps of labelled hierarchical data.
Version: 0.1.0

Description: This package allows contains functions for the creation of heatmaps using labelled hiearchical data. 
Specifically, for data with a two-level hierarchical structure, it will produce a heatmap where each row and column represents a category at the lower level.
These rows and columns are then grouped by the higher-level group each category belongs to, with the names for each category and groups shown in the margins. 
While other packages (e.g. `dendextend`) allow heatmap rows and columns to be arranged by groups, I believe this is the only R package which also labels the 
data at both levels - i.e. both category and group names are shown of the left and bottm margins.
