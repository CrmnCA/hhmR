# Away Week Plan

Please add your research questions/ideas here and drop any useful data and reference in the relevant folder.

## Aims / Research questions

* What have been the spatial clusters of COVID-19 cases and mortality (deaths and excess deaths)?
* How have the geography of COVID-19 been related to local testing volumes and positivity rates? (Not sure if the data for this are available)
* Which socio-economic and demographic attributes have been most strongly associated with a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases and mortality? (Here I am thinking of looking at key socio-economic variables capturing affluence/deprivation and demographic attributes like age and ethinicity.
* What have these patterns interacted with non-phamaceuthical interventions?
* How have these patterns changed over the course of the pandemic in response to different types of interventions, COVID-19 variants, testing and vaccination rollout?

## Ideas

- Unequal impact of COVID / marked patterns of socio-economic inequality and segregation / differentiated impacts over time
- Exposure to COVID-19 has been higher among more socio-economically disadvantaged groups because of their capacity to work from home; and, the nature of their jobs.
- It may be worth thinking of the project in terms of analytical packages so we can define and link questions, methods, data and output

## What do we know so far

- More socio-economically disadvantaged areas did not report reduced levels of mobility during lockdown restrictions relative to more socio-economically advantaged areas
